## Javascript-Work Day calendar Challenge 2021
---
# During the course of this assignment, I have used many ressoures which include but are not limited to mdn documentation,
momentjs, fontawesome icons, google api, CDN documentation.

* The creation of this app has helped me learn how I use the DOM to manipulate various html Element in Javascript, 
using different methods like the "getElementsbyId" and "querySelector" and "querySelectorAll" to apply different behavior through the elements and buttons. I use the "addEventistener"  method to help achieve that. Most importantly JQUERY has helped simplify the process..

 I also use local storage to facilitate storing of users information like their initial and score in local computer, which later can be conveniently retrieved. By using the moment.js documentation, I was to get the military time that facilites the display of the time block (standard business hours)based on some if else statement.

## Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:


* At the landing page, the user is presented with a calendar which provides different times of the dayfrom from which they will enter their activities. After they enter the chosen activites even after the page is reloaed it is saved in local Storage.
The user  is allowed to save events for each hour of the day.

* Once an activity is completed, it is grayed out from the time it was completed.

 Overall, it was a great learning experience and this activity has helped me greatly advanced in my road to becoming a web developper.
