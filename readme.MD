Javascript-Calendar--Challenge 2021

## Javascript-Calendar Challenge
---
# During the course of this assignment, I have used many ressoures which include but are not limited to mdn documentation,
momentjs, fontawesome icons.

* The creation of this app helped me learn how I can select different Html elements to manipulate DOM, using different methods like the "getElementsbyId" and "querySelector" and "querySelectorAll" to apply different behavior through the elements and buttons. I use the "addEventistener"  method to help achieve that.

 I also use local storage to facilitate storing of users information like their initial and score in local computer, which later can be conveniently retrieved.

## Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:


* At the landing page, the user is presented with a calendar which provides differen times of the work from from which they will enter their activities

* Once an activity is completed, it is grayed out from the time it was completed.
